# Division of Two numbers

# let num1 and num2 
# Take input from user
num1 = input("Enter the value of num1: ")
num2 = input("Enter the value of num2: ")

# Here division is intialised to num1 + num2
division = int(num1) / int(num2)

# Printing the division of two numbers
print("Division of Two : ", division)
